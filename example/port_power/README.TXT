Many of these examples open a port named "/in" or "/out".

You can connect any program with an "/out" to a program with an "/in" using:
    yarp connect /out /in

Similarly for ports called:
    /target/raw/out and /target/raw/in

The examples follow the "Port Power" tutorial.  Do a web search for
YARP port power, or go to the last known address of the tutorial:
