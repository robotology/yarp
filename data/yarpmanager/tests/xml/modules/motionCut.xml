    <name>motionCUT</name>
    <description>The module exploits the pyramidal Lucas-Kanade algorithm to detect independent moving points over a selectable grid of nodes. The algorithm is designed in such a way that it works also - and especially - with moving cameras. </description>

    <!-- physical and logical resource dependencies can be introduced in this
         section. Dependencies must follow resource conceptional models. Currently
         available resource models are 'memory', 'processor', 'storage', 'network',
         'yarp_port', 'platform' and 'gpu'. All resource dependencies should be introduced
         inside <computer></computer> tags. While resources described inside <computer>
         tags represent conjunctional dependency, resources from different <computer>
         tags can be seen as disjunctions. Meaning that If a module depend on either
         resource R1 or R2 they can be introduced inside two different <computer> tags.
         Resource dependencies should be introduced if they are really required. For
         example, if module's performance drops significantly in case of memory swapping,
         a memory resource dependency can be introduced with the required memory space. -->
