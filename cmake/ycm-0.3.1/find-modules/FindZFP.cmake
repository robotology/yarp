# FindZFP
# -------
#
# Find the ZFP floating point compression library.
#
# Once done this will define the following variables::
#
#   ZFP_INCLUDE_DIRS    - ZFP include directory
#   ZFP_LIBRARIES       - ZFP libraries
#   ZFP_FOUND           - if false, you cannot build anything that requires ZFP
