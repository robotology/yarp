/**
 * @page port_admin The administrative interface to YARP ports

\author Paul Fitzpatrick

Most of the time, YARP ports are conduits for messages.
Users write messages to ports, and read messages from ports,
and the ports themselves don't inspect the content of those
messages.

In some cases, though, you may find yourself wishing to talk
to a port itself, in order to query it about its state, or to
request it to take some action (such as making or breaking a
connection).  There is a low level protocol for this, but it
is somewhat arcane (see \ref yarp_protocol_port).

To send an administrative message to a port is simple.
From the commandline, just use "yarp admin write" or
"yarp admin rpc" instead of "yarp write" or "yarp rpc":
\verbatim
  echo "[list] [in]" | yarp admin rpc /port_name
\endverbatim
This will list all the inputs to the port /port_name.  The square
brackets may be omitted in the current implementation of YARP.

From code, set the "admin" flag in yarp::os::Network::write, or call
yarp::os::Port::setAdminMode.  Messages can be read/written as regular
yarp::os::Bottle objects.  Nothing else is needed.

Here are the things you can do using the administrative
interface:

- \ref port_admin_help
- \ref port_admin_add
- \ref port_admin_del
- \ref port_admin_list
- \ref port_admin_ver

@section port_admin_help help

\verbatim
[help]
\endverbatim

Lists all the available administration commands.


@section port_admin_add add

\verbatim
[add] /port/name
[add] /port/name carrier
\endverbatim

Add an output to the specified port, using a given carrier (tcp, udp, etc.)


@section port_admin_del del

\verbatim
[del] /port/name
\endverbatim

Remove an output to the specified port.


@section port_admin_list list

\verbatim
[list] [in]
[list] [out]
\endverbatim

List input or output connections.


@section port_admin_ver ver

\verbatim
[ver]
\endverbatim

Report the version of the port protocol in operation.
