/**
 * \defgroup dev_all Devices
 *
 * Dealing with devices. What do you need to know to use devices in
 * YARP?  First, we try to write our devices so that they implement a
 * set of \link dev_iface interfaces\endlink.  Your program ideally would use
 * the minimal set of interfaces needed for the particular task you
 * have in mind.  Then you'll be later able to switch to any
 * \link dev_impl implementation \endlink that meets your interface.  This
 * is something you often have to do in robotics.
 *
 * Of course, pretty much every device has some special magic numbers
 * you need to set up at the beginning.  This process of
 * \link dev_class configuration \endlink process is separated out in YARP
 * to make it easy to control it via external command line switches
 * or configuration files.
 *
 * Under normal use, YARP devices are started from the
 * \link dev_runtime commandline\endlink.

/**

 * \defgroup dev_runtime Command-line Accessible Devices
 *
 * Devices that can be created and configured from the command-line.
 * Generally you can create them with the yarpdev command by
 * specifying a "--device" option followed by their name, for example:
 *
 @verbatim
 yarpdev --device test_grabber
 @endverbatim
 *
 * This creates a test_grabber device with default options.  You will
 * generally need to specify additional options, for example:
 *
 @verbatim
 yarpdev --device test_grabber --width 640 --height 480 --name /test
 @endverbatim
 *
 * How do you know what options are available?
 * You can check our list of \ref dev_examples "device invocation examples".
 * Or When you try to run
 * "yarpdev --device yourdevice"
 * and add the "--verbose" flag, it will tell you what options it is
 * checking, and any documentation present for those options.
 *
 * For example, try running:
@verbatim
yarpdev --device test_grabber --verbose
@endverbatim
