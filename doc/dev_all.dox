/**
\defgroup dev_all yarp::dev YARP Devices

Dealing with devices. What do you need to know to use devices in
YARP?  First, we try to write our devices so that they implement a
set of \link dev_iface interfaces\endlink.  Your program ideally would use
the minimal set of interfaces needed for the particular task you
have in mind.  Then you'll be later able to switch to any
\link dev_impl implementation \endlink that meets your interface.  This
is something you often have to do in robotics.

Of course, pretty much every device has some special magic numbers
you need to set up at the beginning.  This process of
\link dev_class configuration \endlink process is separated out in YARP
to make it easy to control it via external command line switches
or configuration files.

YARP devices can be started from the \link dev_runtime commandline\endlink,
via yarprobotinterface or from c++ code.

Devices that can be created and configured from the command-line.
Generally you can create them with the yarpdev command by
specifying a "--device" option followed by their name, for example:

\verbatim
yarpdev --device fakeFrameGrabber
\endverbatim

This creates a fakeFrameGrabber device with default options.  You will
generally need to specify additional options, for example:

\verbatim
yarpdev --device fakeFrameGrabber --width 640 --height 480 --name /test
\endverbatim

How do you know what options are available?
You can check our list of \ref dev_examples "device invocation examples".
Or When you try to run
"yarpdev --device yourdevice"
and add the "--verbose" flag, it will tell you what options it is
checking, and any documentation present for those options.

For example, try running:
\verbatim
yarpdev --device fakeFrameGrabber --verbose
\endverbatim
