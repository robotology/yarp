/**
 * @page yarp_cmake_hello Compiling a YARP hello world program

The easiest way to write your first program using YARP is with CMake.

Make a directory called "hello", and within it put a "CMakeLists.txt"
file like this:

\include example/cmake/hello/CMakeLists.txt

And here's a simple test program, call it "hello.cpp"

\include example/cmake/hello/hello.cpp

Now make a "build" directory inside the "hello" folder, then from the build directory 
run CMake (see \ref using_cmake), and compile!
This example is available in the example/cmake/hello directory
of the YARP source code.  See example/cmake/with_opencv for an
example of compiling YARP with OpenCV.
