/**
 * @page persistent_connections Persistent connections

\author Paul Fitzpatrick

When a connection is made between two YARP ports, that connection
lasts until it is explicitly disconnected by user action, or until one
of the ports is closed.

It is also possible to specify connections that should be made
whenever possible.  These are called "persistent connections".

Normally, to connect two ports from the command line, you do:
\verbatim
yarp connect <source-port> <target-port> [optional-carrier]
\endverbatim
for example:
\verbatim
yarp connect /src /dest mcast
\endverbatim
If both the /src and /dest ports exist, this will create a connection
between them that will last until it is disconnected by a matching call
to "yarp disconnect", or until one of the ports closes.

To create a persistent connection, you instead do:
\verbatim
yarp connect --persist <source-port> <target-port> [optional-carrier]
\endverbatim
for example:
\verbatim
yarp --persist connect /src /dest mcast
\endverbatim
This command will succeed even if /src or /dest do not exist at the moment.
Whenever a port called /src or /dest is created, YARP will check
if it is possible to create this connection, and do so if it can.


\section persistent_connections_example An example of a persistent connection

For example, suppose we do:
\verbatim
yarp connect --persist /write /read
\endverbatim
And then in two terminals we do:
\verbatim
yarp write /write
yarp read /read
\endverbatim
The "yarp write" and "yarp read" programs will be connected automatically,
and something typed on the "yarp write" console will appear on the
"yarp read" console.

If either program is killed and restarted, the connection will reappear.

\section persistent_connections_list Listing persistent connections

To view all persistent connections, type:
\verbatim
yarp connect --persist
\endverbatim

To view all persistent connections involving a particular
port, type:
\verbatim
yarp connect --persist /port
\endverbatim

\section persistent_connections_remove Getting rid of a persistent connection

To stop the automatic creation of connections between two ports /src and
/dest, do:
\verbatim
yarp disconnect --persist /src /dest
\endverbatim

\section persistent_connections_topics Persistence via topics

It is occasionally useful to view a collection of ports as a single
"topic" to read from or write to.
A topic can be created in YARP
by doing:
\verbatim
yarp topic <topic-name>
\endverbatim
For example:
\verbatim
yarp topic /topic
\endverbatim
A topic can be thought of as a repeater port; anything it receives
from any of its inputs, it resends to all its outputs.
This bus-like behavior is often useful, but a bit inefficient.
So in fact YARP topics are entirely virtual, with their
effect achieved via direct connections between the ports connected
to the virtual topic port.

To be concrete, here's how topics work.
Persistent connections can be made between ports and a topic:
\verbatim
yarp connect --persist /src1 /topic
yarp connect --persist /src2 /topic
yarp connect --persist /src3 /topic
yarp connect --persist /topic /dest1
yarp connect --persist /topic /dest2
yarp connect --persist /topic /dest3
\endverbatim
Every input to the topic will be connected to every output from the
topic.  For example, if all of the ports /src1, /src2, /dest1,
and /dest2 exist, then the following connections will be made and
maintained:
\verbatim
yarp connect /src1 /dest1
yarp connect /src1 /dest2
yarp connect /src1 /dest3
yarp connect /src2 /dest1
yarp connect /src2 /dest2
yarp connect /src2 /dest3
yarp connect /src3 /dest1
yarp connect /src3 /dest2
yarp connect /src3 /dest3
\endverbatim
(if carriers are specified in the persistent connections, the carriers for
outgoing connections from the topic are respected and those for
incoming connections to the topic are ignored).

\section persistent_connections_topics_list Listing topics

To get a list of all topics, do:
\verbatim
yarp topic --list
\endverbatim

\section persistent_connections_topics_remove Removing topics

To remove a topic, do:
\verbatim
yarp topic --remove /topic
\endverbatim

\section persistent_connections_code Using persistent connections from code

Normally, to connect two ports directly in code, you do:
\code
#include <yarp/os/Network.h>
...
yarp::os::Network yarp;
yarp.connect("/source","/dest");
\endcode
It is also possible to request connections via topics.  If, in one program,
we do:
\code
#include <yarp/os/Network.h>
...
yarp::os::Network yarp;
yarp.connect("/camera1","topic://vision");
\endcode
and in another, we do:
\code
#include <yarp/os/Network.h>
...
yarp::os::Network yarp;
yarp.connect("topic://vision","/viewer");
\endcode
Then the /camera1 port will end up connecting to the /viewer port whenever
both are available.

The "topic://" prefix is not needed if the "/vision" topic has been
explicitly created as described in \ref persistent_connections_topics.

One note of caution: when connecting to a topic, the "connect" command
may return before all existing ports connected with that topic
becoming connected to each other.  If you rely on a
connection existing, test for it using either yarp::os::Network::isConnected
or yarp::os::Port::getInputCount or yarp::os::Port::getOutputCount.

To connect two ports persistently, without any intermediate topic
(only possible with native YARP name service), use code like this:

\code
#include <yarp/os/Network.h>
#include <yarp/os/ContactStyle.h>
...
yarp::os::Network yarp;
yarp::os::ContactStyle style;
style.persistent = true;
Network::connect("/foo","/bar",style);
\endcode
