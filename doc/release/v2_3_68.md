YARP 2.3.68 (UNRELEASED) Release Notes
======================================


A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+2.3.68%22).


Important Changes
-----------------

### YARP_OS

* The yarp::os::Contact class was widely refactored:
  * The add*() methods are now deprecated. The new set*() methods should be used
    instead.
  * The by*(), invalid() and empty() factory methods are now deprecated. The
    class constructors should be used instead (a few new constructors were added
    to allow this).
  * The byConfig() method is now deprecated. fromConfig() should be used
    instead.
  * The Contact::toURI() method now accepts an includeCarrier parameter (true by
    default) to simplify the generation of the URI without the carrier.
    Moreover the string returned always end with a `/` character.
  * ROS integration was heavily improved and it is now possible to register
    one `Publisher` and one `Subscriber` on the same `Node` using the same
    topic, and to use tools like `roswtf` and `rqt`.
    If you are using YARP with ROS, upgrading is strongly recommended.

### CMake Modules

* All deprecated CMake modules have been removed.
* All GTK2 CMake modules have been removed and are no longer installed in
  `${YARP_MODULE_PATH}`. They can still be found in
  [YCM](http://robotology.github.io/ycm).

### Tools

* `yarpserver2` and `yarpserver3` have been deprecated for a long time, and
  replaced by `yarpserver`, therefore they have been removed. Please update your
  scripts

### GUIs

* All GTK2 GUIs have a Qt5 replacement and have been deprecated since YARP
  2.3.65, therefore they have been removed.


Bug Fixes
---------

### YARP_OS

* Fixed some cases of connections leaving a streaming connection pending.
* Support dynamic plugins when YARP is built without ACE.
* Fixed several possible race conditions in `yarp::os::Thread`.
* `getBusInfo` ROS command was implemented.
* `getMasterUri` ROS command was implemented.
* `getPid` ROS command was fixed and now returns just one integer instead of a
  vector.
* The right caller_id is returned by `PortCore` for `publisherUpdate` and
  `requestTopic` ROS commands.
* The right caller_id is returned by the tcpros carrier.
* `yarp::os::Node` now handles correctly multiple publishers and subscribers on
  the same topic. The limit on YARP is that only one publisher and one
  subscriber can be registered on the same node using the same topic.

### GUIs

* Fixed yarpmanager cannot display and disconnect mjpeg connections (#595).



New Features
------------

### YARP_OS

* Improved PortCore `list [in|out]` commands
  They also return now:
  * `(connectionless 1)` when the connection is connectionless (i.e. udp).
  * `(push 0)` when the connection is not push (i.e. mjpeg).
* Improved compiler detection and added <yarp/conf/compiler.h> header
  containing macros to check if a specific feature is available.
* Added method `yarp::os::Thread::yield()` that reschedules the execution of
  current thread, allowing other threads to run.
* Added method `yarp::os::Contactable::resetReporter()` to remove the
  `PortReport` set by `setReporter()`.

### YARP_math

* Added the `yarp::math::FrameTransform` class.

### YARP_dev

* Added the `yarp::dev::IDepthSensor` and `yarp::dev::IRGBDSensor` interfaces.
* Added the `yarp::dev::IFrameTransform.h interface.
* Added the `transformServer` and `transformClient` devices.

### Modules

* The ControlBoardRemapper device was introduced that is a state-less and
  thread-less YARP device that takes axes belonging to several controlboards and
  expose them as a unique controlboard device.
* The `RGBDSensorClient` and `RGBDSensorWrapper` devices were added.
* Rangefinder2DWrapper: use timetamp from device driver.

### GUIs

* yarpmanager use service tag from module description to add as input/output
  service port
