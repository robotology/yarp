YARP 2.3.72 (UNRELEASED) Release Notes                                {#v2_3_72}
======================================


A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+v2.3.72%22).

Important Changes
-----------------

* All the functionalities deprecated in YARP 2.3.65 and previous releases were
  removed.
* C++11 is required also for using YARP, not just for compiling.
* Optional dependency on YCM now requires version 0.5.1 or later.
* Optional dependency on RTF now requires version 1.3.3 or later.
* Dropped `YARP1` support.
* Changed how JAVA bindings are generated
* `yarp::sig::image::getIplImage()` now can return a null pointer 
  (instead of Teminating with an assert) for not valid Ipl image formats
* `yarp::sig::image::setPixelCode()` now set the pixelSize accordingly (which should not be set).
  since `yarp::sig::image::setPixelSize()` also sets an arbitrary pixel code equal to negative itself
  (setPixelSize(3) will set the pixelCode to -3) it should be use only for image with custom formats
  not covered by a yarp pixelCode.

### Libraries

#### `YARP_OS`

* Clock refactoring: clock type can be initialized in the `yarp::os::Network`
  constructor or in the `Network::init()` function.
  This will take precedence over the environment variable.
  `yarp::os::SystemRateThread` class created as `RateThread` clone but runs
  using system clock only, independently from other settings.
  Any call to `yarp::os::Time::now()` or `delay()` before the object
  `yarp::os::Network` is initialized will abort the program in order to avoid
  undefined behaviour of uninitialized `Time` object
* `Contactable::open(void)` was deprecated. Use `open("...")` instead.
* The following methods in `yarp::os::RateThread` are now `protected` instead
  of `public`:
  * `virtual bool threadInit();`
  * `virtual void threadRelease();`
  * `virtual void run() = 0;`
  * `virtual void beforeStart();`
  * `virtual void afterStart(bool success);`
* The following methods in `yarp::os::PortReaderBufferBase` are now deprecated:
  * `void setAllowReuse(bool flag = true)`
  * `void release(yarp::os::PortReader* completed)`


New Features
------------

### Libraries

#### `YARP_OS`

* Added the property *yarprun* to ports opened through `yarprun --server`.
* Added the property *nameserver* for the port opened through `yarpserver`.
* The method `yarp::os::Network::runNameServer()` was removed.
* Added possibility to enable and disable macOS AppNap (Os.h).
* Added a few missing ConstString::assign overloads.
* Added method 'yarp::os::carrier::createFace()', that returns the needed face
  of the carrier. This method is used in carriers::listen and carriers::connect
  in order to open new connection using the correct face.
* The `YARP_WRAP_STL_STRING` option value is now by default `OFF` on non-MSVC
  platforms. This means that `yarp::os::ConstString` is now by default a typedef
  to `std::string` on these platforms.
* Improve how parameters are given to the chosen carrier for a connection: 
  all parameters given both on registration and on connect command are collected 
  and made available in the connection initialization step.
* Added support for register a contact with an associated carrier different from
  tcp. If the chosen carrier provides a custom yarp::os::Face implementation this
  becomes the handler of incoming connections. In any case the carrier becomes the
  default for future connections.

#### `YARP_dev`

* Added a new interface for visual servoing: `IVisualServoing.h`.
* `yarp::dev::CanBuffer` now supports a `const` version of `operator[]`.

#### `YARP_serversql`

* Added a new `Server` class for using yarp server inside an applications. Both the yarp server application and the yarpserver rtf fixture use it.



### Devices

#### `ovrheadset`

* Added hud element setted by the configuration file and connected diretly to
  image ports

### Carriers
* New H264 carrier. It let you to read and decoding a h264 stream
  published by Gstreamer server.

### GUIs

* New `yarpviz` gui imported from https://github.com/robotology/yarpviz

#### `yarpmanager`

* Imported the `iCubCluster` GUI from iCub
  (https://github.com/robotology/icub-main/tree/master/app/iCubCluster).
  It is available only on Unix.
* Added file system watcher to reload the applications when the xml
  has been modified externally.
* Added `yarp name list` and `yarp clean` actions after importing
  profiling capabilities of `yarpviz`.

#### `yarpview`

* Added in-gui connect functionality (remote port name textfield, carrier textfield and "connect" button).

### RTF Plugins

* `yarpserver`: created a RTF Fixture manager for running yarpserver as a fixture.

### JAVA Bindings

* Completely refactored JAVA Bindings [#1372](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/pull/1372)
  JAVA sources and pre-compiled classes are no more generated during the build process 
  (`PREPARE_CLASS_FILES` option has been removed too).
  Two `.jar` files are instead generated and installed:
  * `<install_dir>/share/yarp/java/yarp.jar`: contains all the YARP JAVA classes
  * `<install_dir>/share/yarp/java/yarp_matlab_java.jar`: contains JAVA utilities for MATLAB
  The JNI libraries to be loaded by the JAVA application is now called `libyarp_java.jnilib` 
  and it is installed in `<install_dir>/lib/jni/libyarp_java.jnilib`
* Changed `package` of JAVA MATLAB Utilities: from global package to `yarp.matlab`

Bug Fixes
---------

### Libraries

#### `YARP_OS`

* Added `unprepare` method to `Publisher`. See `BufferedPort` for documentation on how to use `prepare` and `unprepare` [#1425](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/pull/1425)
* Optimized `Stamp::read()` and `Stamp::write()` for textMode.

#### `YARP_sig`
* fixed pixelSize information loss in `fleximage:::read()`

### GUIs

#### yarpmanager

* Fixed the check of the status of the Computers, now it verifies that the
  corresponding port has been opened through `yarp run`. Be aware that after
  these changes `yarpmanager` will not detect machines with `yarp 2.3.70`
  and earlier.
* Added scan among the available carriers when you click connect and disconnect,
  if the specified carrier is not available a proper error message will be
  written on log.
* the column carrier in the connection list has been substituted with a combobox
  with the available carriers.
* Added modifiers column in the connection list for portmonitors.
* Added automatic ports/resources refresh after `run/stop/kill`.
* Added the possibility to switch broker run-time, from `LocalBroker` to
  `YarpBroker` and viceversa.

#### yarpdataplayer

* Fixed `yarpdataplayer` going to idle because of AppNap on macOS (#1153)
