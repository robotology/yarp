YARP 2.3.72 (UNRELEASED) Release Notes                                {#v2_3_72}
======================================


A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+v2.3.72%22).

Important Changes
-----------------

* All the functionalities deprecated in YARP 2.3.65 and previous releases were
  removed.
* C++11 is required also for using YARP, not just for compiling.
* Optional dependency on YCM now requires version 0.5.1 or later.

### Libraries

#### `YARP_OS`

* Clock refactoring: clock type can be initialized in the `yarp::os::Network`
  constructor or in the `Network::init()` function.
  This will take precedence over the environment variable.
  `yarp::os::SystemRateThread` class created as `RateThread` clone but runs
  using system clock only, independently from other settings.
  Any call to `yarp::os::Time::now()` or `delay()` before the object
  `yarp::os::Network` is initialized will abort the program in order to avoid
  undefined behaviour of uninitialized `Time` object
* `Contactable::open(void)` was deprecated. Use `open("...")` instead.


New Features
------------

### Libraries

#### `YARP_OS`

* Added the property *yarprun* to ports opened through `yarprun --server`.
* Added the property *nameserver* for the port opened through `yarpserver`.
* The method `yarp::os::Network::runNameServer()` was removed.
* Added possibility to enable and disable macOS AppNap (Os.h)

#### `YARP_dev`

* Added a new interface for visual servoing: `IVisualServoing.h`.


### Devices

#### `ovrheadset`

* Added hud element setted by the configuration file and connected diretly to
  image ports


### GUIs

* New `yarpviz` gui imported from https://github.com/robotology/yarpviz

#### `yarpmanager

* Imported the `iCubCluster` GUI from iCub
  (https://github.com/robotology/icub-main/tree/master/app/iCubCluster).
  It is available only on Unix.


Bug Fixes
---------

### GUIs

#### yarpmanager

* Fixed the check of the status of the Computers, now it verifies that the
  corresponding port has been opened through `yarp run`. Be aware that after
  these changes `yarpmanager` will not detect machines with `yarp 2.3.70`
  and earlier.
* Added scan among the available carriers when you click connect and disconnect,
  if the specified carrier is not available a proper error message will be
  written on log.
* the column carrier in the connection list has been substituted with a combobox
  with the available carriers.
* Added modifiers column in the connection list for portmonitors.
* Added automatic ports/resources refresh after `run/stop/kill`.

#### yarpdataplayer

* Fixed `yarpdataplayer` going to idle because of AppNap on macOS (#1153)
