Bug Fixes

  these changes `yarpmanager` will not detect machines with `yarp 2.3.70`
  and earlier.
* Added scan among the available carriers when you click connect and disconnect,
  if the specified carrier is not available a proper error message will be
  written on log.
* the column carrier in the connection list has been substituted with a combobox
  with the available carriers.
* Added modifiers column in the connection list for portmonitors.
* Added automatic ports/resources refresh after `run/stop/kill`.
