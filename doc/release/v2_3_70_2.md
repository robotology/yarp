========================================


A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+v2.3.70.2%22).

Important Changes
-----------------

### Libraries

#### `YARP_OS`

* Unification of code in `DGramTwoWayStream` for the allocation of write
  and read buffers (https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues/899).

Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed several warnings reported by clang static analyzer.
* Fixed warnings reported by coverity static analyzer migrating 
  `yarp::os::Random` from `cstdlib`'s functions `rand` and `srand` 
  to C++11 `std::default_random_engine`. `yarp::os::Random` methods are not 
  influencing anymore the global state of `rand` and `srand`.

### Libraries

#### YARP_OS

* Fixed truncation of double in `Property::fromString()`.
* Fixed append to wrong string in `BufferedConnectionWriter.h`.

### Tools

* Added the fallback port in `yarpserver` also if `yarp`
  is compiled without ACE, since we support mcast without
  ACE since `v2.3.70`.
