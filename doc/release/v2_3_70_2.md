Important Changes
-----------------

### Libraries

#### `YARP_OS`

* Unification of code in `DGramTwoWayStream` for the allocation of write
  and read buffers (#899).
* Added extra checks in the port names in `Network:metaConnect()`, with
  dedicated error messages.

#### `YARP_math`

* The `RandScalar` methods are now using C++11 `mersenne_twister_engine` instead
  of a custom engine.

### Carriers

* `portmonitor`, `rossrv`, `tcpros`, and `xmlrpc` carriers can now be enabled
  when `SKIP_ACE` is `ON`.


Bug Fixes
---------

* Fixed several warnings reported by clang static analyzer.

### Libraries

#### YARP_OS

* Fixed truncation of double in `Property::fromString()`.
* Fixed append to wrong string in `BufferedConnectionWriter.h`.
* Fixed `yarp::os::ConstString::getline` for MSVC (#1357).
* Reverted `flush()` added in YARP v2.3.71.1 at the end of
  `AbstractCarrier::writeYarpInt()`.

#### YARP_dev

* Fixed RPC calls when connecting to right image port (split mode on)

### Tools

* Added the fallback port in `yarpserver` also if `yarp`
  is compiled without ACE, since we support mcast without
  ACE since `v2.3.70`.
* Fixed `yarpdev --list` for Windows.
