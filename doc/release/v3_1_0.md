New Features
------------

### Libraries

#### YARP_OS

* `Vocab` is now a namespace, and `yarp::os::createVocab` replaces `VOCAB1\2\3\4`
  that are now deprecated.

#### YARP_DEV

* The following files have been renamed:
  * `yarp/dev/ImplementControlLimits.h`
    (from `yarp/dev/IControlLimitsImpl.h`)
  * `yarp/dev/ImplementControlLimits2.h`
    (from `yarp/dev/IControlLimits2Impl.h`)
  * `yarp/dev/ImplementInteractionMode.h`
    (from `yarp/dev/IInteractionModeImpl.h`)
  * `yarp/dev/ImplementPidControl.h`
    (from `yarp/dev/IPidControlImpl.h`)
  * `yarp/dev/ImplementPositionControl.h`
    (from `yarp/dev/IPositionControlImpl.h`)
  * `yarp/dev/ImplementPositionControl2.h`
    (from `yarp/dev/IPositionControl2Impl.h`)
  * `yarp/dev/ImplementPositionDirect.h`
    (from `yarp/dev/IPositionDirectImpl.h`)
  * `yarp/dev/ImplementVelocityControl.h`
    (from `yarp/dev/IVelocityControlImpl.h`)
  * `yarp/dev/ImplementVelocityControl2.h`
    (from `yarp/dev/IVelocityControl2Impl.h`)
  * `yarp/dev/ImplementVirtualAnalogSensor.h`
    (from `yarp/dev/IVirtualAnalogSensorImpl.h`)
* The following classes have been refactored.
  * These classes are no more template classes:
    * ImplementControlCalibration
    * ImplementAmplifierControl
    * ImplementEncoders
  * Class definitions were moved from
    `yarp/dev/ImplementControlBoardInterfaces.h` to:
    * `yarp/dev/ImplementControlCalibration.h`
    * `yarp/dev/ImplementAmplifierControl.h`
    * `yarp/dev/ImplementEncoders.h`
  * File `yarp/dev/ControlBoardInterfacesImpl-inl.h` has been removed.
* Class `IControlCalibration` refactored.
  The following methods were renamed:
  * `done(int j)` -> `calibrationDone(int j)`
  * `doneRaw(int j)` -> `calibrationDoneRaw(int j)`
  * `calibrate()` -> `calibrateRobot()`
* Class `IControlCalibrationRaw` refactored.
  The following methods were renamed:
  * `calibrateRaw(int, unsigned int, double, double, double)` ->
    `calibrateAxisWithParamsRaw(int, unsigned int, double, double, double)`
  * `calibrate(int, unsigned int, double, double, double)` ->
    `calibrateAxisWithParams(int, unsigned int, double, double, double)`
* The file `yarp/dev/ControlBoardInterfaces.h` has been split into multiple
  files:
  * `yarp/dev/IAmplifierControl.h`
  * `yarp/dev/IAxisInfo.h`
  * `yarp/dev/IControlDebug.h`
  * `yarp/dev/IControlLimits.h`

  
#### YARP_sig

* `Vector` made typedef of `VectorOf<double>`(#1598).

### Devices

#### imuBosch_BNO055

* Added support for i2c.

#### yarp_test_grabber

* Added test [time] which draws a text timestamp directly on the image.

### Tools

#### yarp

* Added `yarp name runners` command to get a list of the ports offering
  `yarprun` utilities

### Bindings

#### IInteractionMode interface bindings

* Added bindings for the interface IInteractionMode.
  The change extends the `yarp::dev::IInteractionMode` and the
  `yarp::dev::IImpedanceControl` classes.

#### Multiple Analog Sensors interfaces bindings

* Minor refactoring of main header `MultipleAnalogSensorsInterfaces.h` defining
  the interfaces:
  `IThreeAxisGyroscopes`, `IThreeAxisLinearAccelerometers`,
  `IThreeAxisMagnetometers`, `IOrientationSensors`, `ITemperatureSensors`,
  `ISixAxisForceTorqueSensors`, `IContactLoadCellArrays`, `IEncoderArrays`,
  `ISkinPatches`.
* Extended these interfaces for wrapping the cast functions
  `(PolyDriver*)->view(<sensor_interface*>)`.
* For this purpose, defined and used a new macro `CAST_POLYDRIVER_TO_INTERFACE`.
* extended the new interfaces for wrapping all other methods which Swig
  struggles to handle, using a new Swig macro defined in
  `macrosForMultipleAnalogSensors.i`
* refactored the `from/toMatlab()` wrappers and extended them to the classes:
  `std::vector<double>`, `std::vector<bool>`, `std::vector<int>`,
  `yarp::sig::Vector`.
