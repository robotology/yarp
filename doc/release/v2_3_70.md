======================================

A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+2.3.70%22).


Important Changes
-----------------

### Build System

* A compiler supporting C++11 is now required.
* CMake 3.0 or newer is now required.
* Optional dependency on YCM now requires version 0.3.1 (devel) or later.
* [Robot Testing Framework (RTF)](https://github.com/robotology/robot-testing/)
  1.1.0.1 is now an optional dependency.

### CMake Modules

* `YarpPlugin`
  * The following commands, deprecated since YARP 2.3.21, were removed:
    * `BEGIN_PLUGIN_LIBRARY`
    * `ADD_PLUGIN_NORMALIZED`
    * `PREPARE_PLUGIN`
    * `PREPARE_DEVICE`
    * `PREPARE_CARRIER`
    * `END_PLUGIN_LIBRARY`
    * `ADD_PLUGIN_LIBRARY_EXECUTABLE`
    * `YARP_ADD_PLUGIN_LIBRARY_EXECUTABLE`


### Libraries

#### YARP_dev

* Opening a device using a configuration of type `(device (device (foo bar)))`
  is now deprecated, use `(device (foo bar))` instead.
* **Gaze control**: added sync equivalent to lookAt-like methods in order to wait
  for reply.
* Added iRobotDescription interface

#### YARP_math

* YARP_math can no longer be built using GSL. The `CREATE_LIB_MATH_USING_GSL`
  option was removed. Only Eigen is supported. `FindGSL.cmake` is no longer
  installed.
* Added template class `Vec2d<>`. can be only instantiated as int or double.


### Devices

#### `RobotDescriptionServer`

* Added new device `RobotDescriptionServer` to store devices info.

#### `RobotDescriptionClient`

* Added new device `RobotDescriptionClient`. User module can ask a list of registered 
  devices using the iRobotDescription interface.

#### `RemoteControlBoard`

* Dropped compatibility with `ControlBoardWrapper2` devices that does not have
  the `stateExt:o` port.
  The `state:o` port in the wrapper is still available for encoder reading.
* The protocol was changed and compatibility for devices using the old protocol
  was dropped.

#### `AnalogWrapper`

* ROS param was changed from `joint_names` to `jointNames` like the
  `controlBoardWrapper`. The old name is deprecated.
* Deprecated all the constructors except for the one without arguments.

#### `TestFrameGrabber`

* The `TestFrameGrabber` was removed from libYARP_dev and it is now an optional
  plugin.


New Features
------------

### CMake Modules

* `YarpPlugin`
  * Add QUIET/VERBOSE arguments and YarpPlugin_QUIET/VERBOSE variables.


### Libraries

* New library `libYARP_rtf` to simplify the creation of unit tests using the
  [Robot Testing Framework (RTF)](https://github.com/robotology/robot-testing/)
  and YARP. This is a slightly modified version of the RTF_YARP_utilities
  library in RTF 1.0.
  It can be enabled with the option `YARP_COMPILE_RTF_ADDONS`.


### GUIs

#### `yarplaserscannergui`

* Accept --help argument.

#### `yarpview`

* Added `--autosize` and checkbox to force yarpview to resize whenever a frame
  of a different size is received.
* Implemented dragvector function on yarpview. Left-click on the image and keep
  left button pressed: yarpview starts to draw a line.
  When the left button is released, the coordinates of the initial and the final
  point are sent to the 'out' yarp port.

#### `yarpmotorgui`:

* Create an instance of `RobotDescriptionClient` to automatically get the names
  of robot parts.
* New button "idle all parts".
* New button "execute script1/2".
* New button "goto to custom position1/2".

#### `yarpmanager`

* Handle also wait states upon shutting down the modules of an application
  (#1051).
* Added local and environment variable parsing (#885, #1031).


### Carriers

* New ZFP carrier for compressing floating point arrays (see
  http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/floating-point-compression).


### Devices

* Reduce message size of controlboardwrapper stateExt:o of nearly 30%.
* ServerFrameGrabber now implements the interface yarp::dev::IRgbVisualParams
  for parsing rgb camera parameters.
* TestFrameGrabber now implements the interface yarp::dev::IRgbVisualParams
  for parsing rgb camera parameters.
* Added getRgbResolution and getRgbSupportedConfigurations in the interface IRgbVisualParams


### RTF Plugins

* The `yarpmanager` RTF Fixture Managers was imported from
  robotology/robot-testing, and allows one to start a fixture using yarpmanager.
  It can be enabled with the option `YARP_COMPILE_RTF_ADDONS`.

* The `yarpplugin` RTF Fixture Managers was imported from robotology/icub-tests
  (Originally YarpPluginFixture), and allows one to check if a yarp plugin is
  available.
  It can be enabled with the option `YARP_COMPILE_RTF_ADDONS`.


Bug Fixes
---------

### Tools

#### `yarprobotinterface`

* Print a warning when when parenthesis are not balanced and added protection
  against syntax errors (#832).
* Added option `all` to attach to all yarprobotinterface devices (used by
  `RobotDescriptionServer`)


### GUIs

#### `yarpmotorgui`

* The number of parts is no longer hardcoded.
* It is now possible to close the gui using CTRL+C.
* Fixed issue preventing correct save operation of position sequences.

#### `yarpmanager`

* Sub-folders are now automatically loaded by default.
* Opening single application multiple times is no longer allowed (#1007).


### Devices

#### `laserFromDepth`

* Added horizontal flip to align angle direction.
* Added distortion to simulate RGBD devices distance calculation method.
