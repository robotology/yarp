======================================

A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+v2.3.70%22).


Important Changes
-----------------

### System Configuration

* The `YARP_CONF` environment variable has been deprecated for a long time
  (since April 2013) and it is no longer used. Since there was not a proper
  warning, the warning is printed now at runtime when the variable is set. See
  [`ResourceFinder::getConfigHome()` documentation](http://yarp.it/classyarp_1_1os_1_1ResourceFinder.html)
  for informations about paths used by YARP to detect the configuration files.
  If you still need to use the `YARP_CONF` for some reason, you can use the
  `YARP_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable instead.

### Build System

* A compiler supporting C++11 is now required.
* CMake 3.0 or newer is now required.
* Optional dependency on YCM now requires version 0.3.1 (devel) or later.
* [Robot Testing Framework (RTF)](https://github.com/robotology/robot-testing/)
  1.1.0.1 is now an optional dependency.

### CMake Modules

* `YarpPlugin`
  * The following commands, deprecated since YARP 2.3.21, were removed:
    * `BEGIN_PLUGIN_LIBRARY`
    * `ADD_PLUGIN_NORMALIZED`
    * `PREPARE_PLUGIN`
    * `PREPARE_DEVICE`
    * `PREPARE_CARRIER`
    * `END_PLUGIN_LIBRARY`
    * `ADD_PLUGIN_LIBRARY_EXECUTABLE`
    * `YARP_ADD_PLUGIN_LIBRARY_EXECUTABLE`

* `YarpInstallationHelpers`
  *  A new command `yarp_configure_plugins_installation` has been introduced to
     simplify installation of YARP plugins when
     `yarp_configure_external_installation` is not invoked.

### Libraries

* A lot of refactoring was performed in order to improve c++11 usage and to
  simplify porting to other platforms without ACE

#### YARP_OS

* The `i` command is now enabled only in `Debug` and `DebugFull` builds.
* The following commands have been marked as _deprecated_ and will be removed in
  future version of YARP:
  * `yarp::os::exit()`
  * `yarp::os::abort()`
  * `yarp::os::signal()`
  * `yarp::os::ResourceFinder::setContext(const char* contextName)`

#### YARP_dev

* Opening a device using a configuration of type `(device (device (foo bar)))`
  is now deprecated, use `(device (foo bar))` instead.
* **Gaze control**: added sync equivalent to lookAt-like methods in order to wait
  for reply.
* Added iRobotDescription interface.
* Added two new motion control interfaces: IPWMControl, ICurrentControl and related helpers for units conversions.
* Removed some old interfaces methods, deprecated since yarp 2.3.65. i.e: setPositionDirectMode() setPositionMode() setVelocityMode() setOpenLoopMode setTorqueMode() etc.
* Removed Interface IOpenLoopControl, deprecated since yarp 2.3.65.
* Removed deprecated device ClientControlBoard and related tests.
* Removed deprecated device ServerControlBoard and related tests.


#### YARP_math

* YARP_math can no longer be built using GSL. The `CREATE_LIB_MATH_USING_GSL`
  option was removed. Only Eigen is supported. `FindGSL.cmake` is no longer
  installed.
* Added template class `Vec2d<>`. can be only instantiated as int or double.
* Added operator*(quaternion, quaternion) overload for quaternion multiplication
* Added normalize method in the quaternion class


### Devices

#### `RobotDescriptionServer`

* Added new device `RobotDescriptionServer` to store devices info.

#### `RobotDescriptionClient`

* Added new device `RobotDescriptionClient`. User module can ask a list of
  registered devices using the iRobotDescription interface.

#### `RemoteControlBoard`

* Dropped compatibility with `ControlBoardWrapper2` devices that does not have
  the `stateExt:o` port.
  The `state:o` port in the wrapper is still available for encoder reading.
* The protocol was changed and compatibility for devices using the old protocol
  was dropped.
* added implementation of IPWMControl, ICurrentControl.
* added control modes: VOCAB_CM_CURRENT, VOCAB_CM_PWM.
* Added new values in the statExt : pwmDutycycle, current.
* Removed deprecated value from statExt: PidOutput.

#### `AnalogWrapper`

* ROS param was changed from `joint_names` to `jointNames` like the
  `controlBoardWrapper`. The old name is deprecated.
* Deprecated all the constructors except for the one without arguments.

#### `TestFrameGrabber`

* The `TestFrameGrabber` was removed from libYARP_dev and it is now an optional
  plugin.

#### `ovrheadset`

* Ported to the latest Oculus SDK. Compatibility with the old SDK was dropped.
  Supporting both the old and the new SDK is really not worth the effort.
  Therefore, since Linux and macOS are not supported by the latest SDK, only
  Windows is currently supported. If you need support on Linux or macOS you can
  checkout commit `a05fec65e7bc67cceba5c59f26881e98590fccf7` from git history.

* A few options (`--multisample`, `--no-overdrive`, `--no-hqdistortion`, and
  `--no-timewarp`) and the relative toggles were removed, since they can no
  longer be enabled/disabled from the SDK .

#### `ServerGrabber`

* Added new device `ServerGrabber` to handle one or two camera devices in
  function of the configuration.

New Features
------------

### CMake Modules

* `YarpPlugin`
  * Add QUIET/VERBOSE arguments and YarpPlugin_QUIET/VERBOSE variables.


### Libraries

* New library `libYARP_rtf` to simplify the creation of unit tests using the
  [Robot Testing Framework (RTF)](https://github.com/robotology/robot-testing/)
  and YARP. This is a slightly modified version of the RTF_YARP_utilities
  library in RTF 1.0.
  It can be enabled with the option `YARP_COMPILE_RTF_ADDONS`.

#### YARP_OS

* added clear() method to PID class.


#### YARP_dev

* Added `getRgbResolution` and `getRgbSupportedConfigurations` to the
 `IRgbVisualParams` interface.
* Added the new `yarp::dev::IJoypadController` interface and the new
  `JoypadControlClient` and `JoypadControlServer` devices.

* Accept --help argument.

#### `yarpview`

* Added `--autosize` and checkbox to force yarpview to resize whenever a frame
  of a different size is received.
* Implemented dragvector function on yarpview. Left-click on the image and keep
  left button pressed: yarpview starts to draw a line.
  When the left button is released, the coordinates of the initial and the final
  point are sent to the 'out' yarp port.

#### `yarpmotorgui`:

* Create an instance of `RobotDescriptionClient` to automatically get the names
  of robot parts.
* New button "idle all parts".
* New button "execute script1/2".

### Devices

* Added new `SDLJoypad` device.

#### `controlboardwrapper`

* Reduced message size of of the stateExt:o port of nearly 30%.

#### `ServerFrameGrabber`

* `ServerFrameGrabber` now implements the interface yarp::dev::IRgbVisualParams
  for parsing rgb camera parameters.

#### `TestFrameGrabber`

* `TestFrameGrabber` now implements the interface yarp::dev::IRgbVisualParams
  for parsing rgb camera parameters.

#### `ovrheadset`

* It can now display YARP logo in the bottom-right corner (disable with
  `--no-logo` from command line or toggle with `[T]` while running). This is
  useful to ensure that the device is working while waiting for the connection.

* It can now display a crosshairs at the center of the scene (disable with
 `--no-crosshairs` from command line or toggle with `[C]` while running).

* It can now be connected to a battery and display the status as an overlay
  at the top-right corner (disable with `--no-battery` from command line or
  toggle with `[B]` while running)


### RTF Plugins

* The `yarpmanager` RTF Fixture Managers was imported from
  robotology/robot-testing, and allows one to start a fixture using yarpmanager.
  It can be enabled with the option `YARP_COMPILE_RTF_ADDONS`.

* The `yarpplugin` RTF Fixture Managers was imported from robotology/icub-tests
  (Originally YarpPluginFixture), and allows one to check if a yarp plugin is
  available.
  It can be enabled with the option `YARP_COMPILE_RTF_ADDONS`.
