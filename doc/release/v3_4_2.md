### Libraries

#### `os`

##### `LogComponent`

* Log components are now printed in colors when `YARP_COLORED_OUTPUT` is
  enabled.

#### `NameSpace`

* Fix `checkNetwork` timeout variant not working as `checkNetwork`
  when `NetworkBase::setLocalMode(true)` is called.---


#### `sig`

##### `PointCloudTypes`

* Fixed logging of RGBA values via `toString()` for types `DataRGBA`,
  `DataXYZRGBA` and `DataXYZNormalRGBA`.

##### `utils`

* Fixed ROI bug in `depthToPC()`, values are now correctly clipped.


### Devices

#### `controlboardwrapper2`

* Fixed access to the timestamp not protected by mutex (#2396).
* Deprecated old format of `networks` keyword in the XML files to favor the use
  of parentheses.

#### `ffmpeg`

* Corrected a minor error in `FfmpegGrabber.cpp` that caused a segmentation
  fault when using a video with audio track as a `source` for the device.

#### `realsense2`

* Avoid dereferencing nullptr on optional argument.


### Tools

#### `yarpmotorgui`

* Fixed UI file (slider options). Some text was truncated.

#### `yarpmobilebasegui`

* Fixed gui buttons when the value of max linear/angular velocity is < 0



### GUIs

#### `yarpviz`

* Added a new menu voice `View`-> `Render options`.
  This checkable option labbelled `Background grid` allows to enable/disable the
  background grid.
* Labels are now fully readable regardless of their length.
