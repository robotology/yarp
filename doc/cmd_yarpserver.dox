  --config filename.conf   Load options from a file.
  --portdb ports.db        Store port information in named database.
                           Must not be on an NFS file system.
                           Set to :memory: to store in memory (faster).
  --subdb subs.db          Store subscription information in named database.

This starts a name server running on the current machine, optionally
specifying the socket-port to listen to (default whatever was used in
the previous invocation, as recorded in a configuration file, or 10000
if this is the first time to run).
Also, the IP by which the name server should be identified can
optionally be specified (default is a fairly random choice of
the IPs associated with the current machine).

The address of the name server can be determined using
\ref yarp_where.  The address is cached in a configuration
file - see \ref yarp_conf.

If possible, a fallback multi-cast server will be started with IP
224.2.1.1 and port number 10001.  The purpose of this server is
to allow yarp processes to find the yarp name server in the absence
of correct configuration.
