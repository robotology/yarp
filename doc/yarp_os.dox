@section intro_sec Introduction
 *
Welcome to the YARP OS library.  This library interfaces
with your operating system and provides some basic services.
We give you
\link yarp::os::Thread Thread\endlink,
\link yarp::os::Semaphore Semaphore\endlink, and
\link yarp::os::Time Time\endlink
services just in case
you don't have them, but our main goal is to give you easy network
communication using the YARP
\link yarp::os::Port Port\endlink
Network.

@section what_is_a_port What is a Port?
 *
A \link yarp::os::Port Port\endlink is an object that can read and
write values to peer objects spread throughout a network of
computers.  You can create them in your program, and then add and
remove connections either from that program, from the command line,
or from another program.
Ports are specialized for streaming communication, such as camera
images or motor commands.  You can switch network protocols for any
or all your connections without changing a line of code.
For more details, see
\subpage terms "specification of YARP terms and protocols".
