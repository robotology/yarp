\section check_basic_functionalities Check basic YARP functionalities

The first step is to have the \c yarpserver running.

At a terminal type:
\code
 yarpserver
\endcode

Depending on your system the console will look something like this:

\image html check-your-installation-yarpserver.png

If you type on a web browser http://127.0.0.1:10000 you get information about
the name server (registered ports, info, etc.).

We can just check functionality by running a simple example. On another terminal
type:

\code
  yarp read /portread
\endcode

on a third terminal:

\code
  yarp write /portwrite
\endcode

and on yet another terminal:

\code
  yarp connect /portwrite /portread
\endcode

you'll see the effect on the name server:

\code
  yarp: registration name /portwrite ip 127.0.0.1 port 10012 type tcp
  yarp: registration name /portread ip 127.0.0.1 port 10002 type tcp
\endcode

Now, anything typed on the YARP write will be sent and printed on the read side.

\section sec-play-recorded-sequence Play a recorded sequence

You can also use the yarpdataplayer to replay a recorded sequence. This will
reproduce all the sensory information available on the real robot during a
simple experiment. Follow the instructions here:
