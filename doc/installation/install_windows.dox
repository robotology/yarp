\subsection install_windows_from_binaries Install from binaries

We provide precompiled binaries for Visual Studio compilers. Download and execute the installer from this page \ref installation_downloads.

You are now ready to check you installation, see \ref check_your_installation.

\subsection install_windows_from_sources Install from sources

Instructions in this page allows you to build YARP from sources. This allows getting the most recent version of the code from the repository or a specific snapshot. The following sections will guide you step by step in the compilation process.

\subsubsection getting_dependencies_windows Getting dependencies

We recommend you follow the procedure described below, which will install precompiled binaries for almost all the required dependencies. Download the YARP installer according to the compiler you use from this page (\ref installation_downloads). Execute the YARP installer. Disable the YARP tick and proceed with the installation.
At the moment the YARP installer is not including the <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org">Eigen</a> matrix header-only library, required by YARP since version 2.3.67.3 .
To install Eigen, as Eigen is an header only library, you can just unzip the archive in a directory,
and point the `EIGEN3_ROOT` environment variable to the directory in which
you uncompressed the archive. In particular `EIGEN3_ROOT` should point to the
directory containing the `signature_of_eigen3_matrix_library` file.

Pick installation directory, all dependencies will be installed in separate folders in this directory:

\image html install-binaries-no-yarp2.png

Alternatively you can compile all dependencies yourself following the procedure here: \ref dependencies (notice however that this can be tedious, time consuming and error prone).

\subsubsection windows_development_environment Setting up development environment

To compile YARP from sources, you need a C++ compiler.

On Windows, you can compile Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition
from the [Microsoft website](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-en/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx#).

Please note that is reccomended to use Visual Studio 2013 because at the moment we do not provide precompiled
binaries for YARP dependencies for Visual Studio 2015.

Besides the C++ compiler you also need the following tools.

\paragraph CMake

Get the latest release from: http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html.
Execute the installer and follow the instructions, no special actions are required.

\paragraph GIT

There are some competing git solutions for Windows. Among them we recommend

\li msysgit (http://msysgit.github.io/)
\li GitHub for Windows (https://windows.github.com/)

\remark Learning git: to get sources you don't need to understand git in detail (just follow our instructions). If you are willing to learn more there are many useful guides available on the internet. Checkout this page to learn more (http://wiki.icub.org/wiki/Learning_more_about_git).

\subsubsection getting_the_sources_windows Getting the sources

To get the source choose one of these addresses:

\li(git read-only) git://github.com/robotology/yarp.git
\li(ssh read+write) git@github.com:robotology/yarp.git
\li(https read+write) https://github.com/robotology/yarp.git

For example:

\code
  cd /home/user
  git clone https://github.com/robotology/yarp.git
\endcode

\subsubsection create_project_files_windows Create YARP project files

\li Run the CMake GUI.
\li Point the entry "Where is the source code" of the GUI to the root directory where you have downloaded YARP (i.e. \c /home/user/yarp).
\li Choose a directory that will store the binaries and the project files. Usually this directory is \c /home/user/yarp/build. This is YARP's build directory.
\li Click on the button "Configure". Select the compiler you would like to use. CMake will normally select the correct compiler (WIN64 is not supported yet). Make sure the compiler matches the precompiled binaries you have installed.

Choose the following options:

\code
 CREATE_GUIS, set to ON
 CREATE_LIB_MATH, set to ON
\endcode

(leave default values as they are unless you know better)

\remark the availability of \c CREATE_GUIS and \c CREATE_LIB_MATH require you have installed the libraries qt and gsl (you have, if you have followed the instructions above).

Project files generation is an iterative process, hit "Configure" until the option "Generate" becomes available. Then hit "Generate" and quit. Note: CMake uses red bars to highlight new options, these are not necessarily errors and can be ignored.

\remark You can optionally change \c CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, this is the directory where you would like to install YARP (default is \c C:/Program Files/YARP).

\remark Do not select other options unless you know what you are doing.

\subsubsection compile_windows Compile

Now we are ready to compile. Go to the build directory (i.e. \c /home/usr/yarp/build) and open the visual studio solution file (\c YARP.sln). In this order:

\li Select \c Debug configuration and build the target \c ALL_BUILD.
\li Select \c Release configuration and build the target \c INSTALL.

\subsubsection set_up_your_environment_windows Setup your environment

 + Set the environment variable \c YARP_DIR so that it points to the installation directory you have chosen (e.g. \c C:/Program Files/YARP). Set \c YARP_DATA_DIRS to %YARP_DIR%/share/yarp.
 + Add to the \c PATH environment variable the paths of the directories bin and lib within the installation directory you have chose (i.e. \c C:/Program Files/YARP/bin and \c C:/Program Files/YARP/lib).

You are now ready to check you installation, see \ref check_your_installation.
