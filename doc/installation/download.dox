\section download_binary Binary releases

\subsection download_windows Windows

\remark Important: to develop code using precompiled binaries packages have to
        match the compiler you use, make sure you download and install the
        correct version (i.e. MSVC 12 for Visual Studio 2013, etc..).
        If in doubt about the version number of your copy of Visual Studio, find
        the internal version number shown for it in this
        [version history table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio#History).
