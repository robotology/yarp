\author Lorenzo Natale and Elena Ceseracciu

YARP defines certain rules that specifies where configuration and data files are installed and searched. It also provides CMake variables and a C++ helper class (the ResourceFinder) to simplify, installing, finding and parsing these files.

Specifications for the ResourceFinder are reported in \subpage yarp_data_dirs and \subpage resource_finder_spec. If you are now interested in the details you can follow these tutorials:
