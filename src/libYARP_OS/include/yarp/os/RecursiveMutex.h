 * RecursiveMutex offers exclusive, recursive ownership semantics:
 *   - A calling thread owns a RecursiveMutex for a period of time that starts
 *     when it successfully calls either lock or tryLock. During this period,
 *     the thread may make additional calls to lock or tryLock.
 *     The period of ownership ends when the thread makes a matching number of
 *     calls to unlock.
 *   - When a thread owns a RecursiveMutex, all other threads will block (for
 *     calls to lock) or receive a false return value (for tryLock) if they
 *     attempt to claim ownership of the RecursiveLock.
 * The behavior of a program is undefined if a RecursiveMutex is destroyed while
 * still owned by some thread.
 * The behavior of a program is undefined if a RecursiveMutex is unlocked by a
 * thread which is not currently owning the RecursiveMutex
