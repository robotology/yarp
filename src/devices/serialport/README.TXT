This driver creates an OS independent serial communications driver for YARP.
We exploit the capacity of ACE (Adaptive Communications Environment) to provide
serial communications.

The companion network wrapper provides a "yarpdev" server for the driver.

Invocation example:

>> yarpdev --device serialport --comport COM4 --file serial.ini

The server opens two ports (defaults /serial/in and /serial/out) that receive
and send Bottles to the clients, containing the characters to send/receive
to/from the serial link.

To test the driver, you may use a rs232 9-pin plun with pins 2 and 3 shortcutted
(rx/tx) then send strings to the input port using yarp write and attach a yarp
read to the output port.
The sent strings should appear unchanged at the yarp read terminal (except for
being broken or having extra control characters from the bottle format).
