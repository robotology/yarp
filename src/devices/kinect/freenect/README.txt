Compilation tips.  Note, freenect is changing rapidly, so you may
need to make fixes on any given day.

 sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
 git clone https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect.git
 cd libfreenect/
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make

 Now go to YARP, turn on device module compilation, turn on kinect and
 primesensecamera, and recompile.
