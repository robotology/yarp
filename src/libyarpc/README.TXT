This is a start at a C interface to YARP.

It is a step towards enabling a more stable ABI.

It will also make more systematic SWIG wrappers easier (multiple
inheritance hard to translate to a lot of languages).

For now, it will be just a wrapper around the C++ implementation.  If
it turns out to be useful, the implementation layering could be
reversed - the C++ classes could be a wrapper around the C
implementation.

This library is not integrated with the main project build, you have
to compile it separately.
