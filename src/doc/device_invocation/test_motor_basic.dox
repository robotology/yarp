Instantiates \ref cmd_device_test_motor "test_motor" device implemented by yarp::dev::TestMotor.
\verbatim
# set up a fake motor control device with 8 joints
device test_motor
axes 8
\endverbatim
If this text is saved in a file called test_motor_basic.ini then the device can be created by doing:
\verbatim
yarpdev --file test_motor_basic.ini
\endverbatim
Of course, the configuration could be passed just as command line options, or as a yarp::os::Property object in a program:
\code
Property p;
p.fromConfigFile("test_motor_basic.ini");
// of course you could construct the Property object on-the-fly
PolyDriver dev;
dev.open(p);
if (dev.isValid()) { /* use the device via view method */ }
\endcode
Here is a list of properties checked when starting up a device based on this configuration file.  Note that which properties are checked can depend on whether other properties are present.  In some cases properties can also vary between operating systems.  So this is just an example

<table>
<tr><td>PROPERTY</td><td>DESCRIPTION</td><td>DEFAULT</td></tr>
<tr><td>device</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>axes</td><td>number of axes to pretend to have</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>delay</td><td>delay in each call for debugging purpose, in ms</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>
