  @page yarp_code_examples Some examples

There are many code examples available in the "example/"
subdirectory of YARP. If you're reading 
this online, click on the \ref examples "examples"
link to see many of them.

Here we work through an example of using YARP communication
between programs.  We will have two programs, a sender and receiver,
simple_sender.cpp and simple_receiver.cpp

Here's simple_sender.cpp:

\include example/os/simple_sender.cpp

Here's simple_receiver.cpp:

\include example/os/simple_receiver.cpp

Here's an example CMakeLists.txt file to help with compiling
if you use CMake
 (of course
you can compile any way you like, you don't have to use CMake).
Make sure you set the YARP_DIR environment variable to point to
where you compiled YARP (or give the path through the CMake GUI).

\verbatim
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.7)
find_package(YARP REQUIRED)
include_directories(${YARP_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(simple_sender simple_sender.cpp)
target_link_libraries(simple_sender ${YARP_LIBRARIES})
add_executable(simple_receiver simple_receiver.cpp)
target_link_libraries(simple_receiver ${YARP_LIBRARIES})
\endverbatim

After compiling, on three separate 
consoles, do:
\verbatim
 yarp server               # this starts the YARP name server
 ./simple_sender           # this runs the sender
 ./simple_receiver         # this runs the receiver
\endverbatim

Or in windows that would be:
\verbatim
 yarp.exe server           # this starts the YARP name server
 simple_sender.exe         # this runs the sender
 simple_receiver.exe       # this runs the receiver
\endverbatim

You'll need to be in the right directories to run the executables,
or have them in your path.

Here's what you should see on the terminal for the sender:
\verbatim
Sent message: testing 1 of 100
Sent message: testing 2 of 100
Sent message: testing 3 of 100
Sent message: testing 4 of 100
...
\endverbatim

Here's what you should see on the terminal for the receiver:
\verbatim
yarp: Receiving input from /sender to /receiver using tcp
Got message: testing 7 of 100
yarp: Removing input from /sender to /receiver
\endverbatim
You can run the receiver many times to connect and reconnect.
