 * This interface is meant to remotize the access of the calibration device

 * a single joint or the whole device and let the calibrator do the job.
 * Main difference between this interface and remotizing the iControlCalibration
 * interfaces is that in this case we are calling a proper iCalibrator device
 * that knows the correct procedure and the correct parameters for the calibration,
 * so that user doesn't have to worry about configuration parameters.
