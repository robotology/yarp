A simple yarp2 HOWTO
--------------------

Or: how I did it in 60 minutes.

This will guide you through the installation and compilation of
YARP2. this works, and has been tested, for Windows and Microsoft
Visual Studio 6 only.

(0) decide a directory where to unpack all and, in general, where to work.
    I use c:\work.

(1) download and compile ACE
        1. dial http://deuce.doc.wustl.edu/ACE-5.5.zip
        2. unpack to c:\work. the archive creates a directory called
           ACE_wrappers, but I prefer to rename it to ACE-5.5 in order
           to avoid confusion with earlier versions of ACE.
        3. create c:\work\ACE-5.5\ace\config.h with the single line
             #include "ace/config-win32.h"
           in it.
        4. in vc++, open c:\work\ACE-5.5\ACE.dsw; compile project ACE, 
           both in release and debug configurations. you should end up 
           with ACE{d}.{lib,dll} in c:\work\ACE-5.5\lib.
        5. add ACE_ROOT = c:\work\ACE-5.5 to env vars, and 
           %ACE_ROOT%\lib to PATH.

(2) download and install CMake

      http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.4/cmake-2.4.2-win32-x86.exe

      (I chose "add cmake to path for all users')

(3) download yarp2 via CVS to c:\work\yarp2. either use the command line

      cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@yarp0.cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/yarp0 login
      cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@yarp0.cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/yarp0 co -P yarp2

    or do the same operations specified above in the winCVS GUI. of
    course, if you already have a username/pwd on the repository, you
    might use your own.

(4) open CMake, indicate c:\work\yarp2 as both the location of the source 
    code and the destination for the EXEs; then hit "configure". you'll 
    get some red variables, but if ACE is configured ok, the only really 
    wrong value should be the yarp installation dir 
    (CMAKE_INSTALLATION_PREFIX), which I select as c:\work\yarp2. 
    Hit configure again, everything should turn gray; hit then
    OK, and a number of .DSP files should appear in c:\work\yarp2

(5) in vc++, open c:\work\yarp2\YARP.dsw and do build > batch build... 
    then choose build. this will compile all yarp pieces in all possible 
    flavours. if the RUN_TESTS and/or PACKAGE projects fail, do not worry. 
    at the end you should have directories c:\work\yarp2\{bin,lib} in which 
    the EXEs and the libraries are, in turn.
    Watch out! the *last* configuration compiled by vc++ is the one 
    you will find in c:\work\yarp2\bin; on my system that is debug, 
    which is quite undesirable. therefore I copied 
    c:\work\yarp2\bin\Release\*.exe back to c:\work\yarp2\bin.

You're done!

You might now want to add c:\work\yarp2\bin to your PATH. try then 
opening a cmd and do "yarp server", then open one more cmd and 
do "yarp check". this should end with "YARP seems OK!".

if you need to install the GUI alongside:

(1) download and install GLADE (the developer's archive!) for Windows:

	http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net

	any version should do, I work fine with 2.10.7. after the installation,
	you should also have a new env var GTK_BASEPATH defined and set to the
	dir you installed Glade to, and %GTK_BASEPATH%\bin should be in the
	PATH env var.

(2) re-run CMake, and this time set the variable CREATE_GUIS to ON. hit
	configure and then ok.

(3) from within vc++, open YARP.dsw and rebuild everything. it should be
	all right.

To test, try this: open a shell and do "yarp server"; then open another one and do "yarpview":
- a window called YARP GTK Image Viewer should pop up
- the yarp server should report a port called /yarpview/i:img being registered.
