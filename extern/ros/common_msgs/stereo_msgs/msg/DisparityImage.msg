# Floating point disparity image. The disparities are pre-adjusted for any
# x-offset between the principal points of the two cameras (in the case
# that they are verged). That is: d = x_l - x_r - (cx_l - cx_r)

# Stereo geometry. For disparity d, the depth from the camera is Z = fT/d.
float32 f # Focal length, pixels
float32 T # Baseline, world units

# Subwindow of (potentially) valid disparity values.
sensor_msgs/RegionOfInterest valid_window

# The range of disparities searched.
# In the disparity image, any disparity less than min_disparity is invalid.
# The disparity search range defines the horopter, or 3D volume that the
# stereo algorithm can "see". Points with Z outside of:
#     Z_min = fT / max_disparity
#     Z_max = fT / min_disparity
# could not be found.
float32 min_disparity
float32 max_disparity

# Smallest allowed disparity increment. The smallest achievable depth range
# resolution is delta_Z = (Z^2/fT)*delta_d.
