 # Single reading from a relative humidity sensor.  Defines the ratio of partial
 # pressure of water vapor to the saturated vapor pressure at a temperature.

 Header header             # timestamp of the measurement
                           # frame_id is the location of the humidity sensor

 float64 relative_humidity # Expression of the relative humidity
                           # from 0.0 to 1.0.
                           # 0.0 is no partial pressure of water vapor
                           # 1.0 represents partial pressure of saturation

 float64 variance          # 0 is interpreted as variance unknown
