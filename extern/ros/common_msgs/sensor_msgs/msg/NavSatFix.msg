# Navigation Satellite fix for any Global Navigation Satellite System
#
# Specified using the WGS 84 reference ellipsoid

# header.stamp specifies the ROS time for this measurement (the
#        corresponding satellite time may be reported using the
#        sensor_msgs/TimeReference message).
#
# header.frame_id is the frame of reference reported by the satellite
#        receiver, usually the location of the antenna.  This is a
#        Euclidean frame relative to the vehicle, not a reference
#        ellipsoid.

# Latitude [degrees]. Positive is north of equator; negative is south.
float64 latitude

# Longitude [degrees]. Positive is east of prime meridian; negative is west.
float64 longitude

# Altitude [m]. Positive is above the WGS 84 ellipsoid
# (quiet NaN if no altitude is available).

# Position covariance [m^2] defined relative to a tangential plane
# through the reported position. The components are East, North, and
# Up (ENU), in row-major order.
#
# Beware: this coordinate system exhibits singularities at the poles.

# If the covariance of the fix is known, fill it in completely. If the
# GPS receiver provides the variance of each measurement, put them
# along the diagonal. If only Dilution of Precision is available,
# estimate an approximate covariance from that.
