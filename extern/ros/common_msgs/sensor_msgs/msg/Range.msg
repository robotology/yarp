# Single range reading from an active ranger that emits energy and reports
# one range reading that is valid along an arc at the distance measured. 
# This message is  not appropriate for laser scanners. See the LaserScan
# message if you are working with a laser scanner.

# This message also can represent a fixed-distance (binary) ranger.  This
# sensor will have min_range===max_range===distance of detection.
# These sensors follow REP 117 and will output -Inf if the object is detected
# and +Inf if the object is outside of the detection range.
