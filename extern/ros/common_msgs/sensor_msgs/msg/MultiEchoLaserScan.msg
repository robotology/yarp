# Single scan from a multi-echo planar laser range-finder
#
# If you have another ranging device with different behavior (e.g. a sonar
# array), please find or create a different message, since applications
# will make fairly laser-specific assumptions about this data

Header header            # timestamp in the header is the acquisition time of 
                         # the first ray in the scan.
                         #
                         # in frame frame_id, angles are measured around 
                         # the positive Z axis (counterclockwise, if Z is up)
                         # with zero angle being forward along the x axis
                         
float32 angle_min        # start angle of the scan [rad]
float32 angle_max        # end angle of the scan [rad]
float32 angle_increment  # angular distance between measurements [rad]

float32 time_increment   # time between measurements [seconds] - if your scanner
                         # is moving, this will be used in interpolating position
                         # of 3d points
float32 scan_time        # time between scans [seconds]

float32 range_min        # minimum range value [m]
float32 range_max        # maximum range value [m]

LaserEcho[] ranges       # range data [m] (Note: NaNs, values < range_min or > range_max should be discarded)
                         # +Inf measurements are out of range
                         # -Inf measurements are too close to determine exact distance.
LaserEcho[] intensities  # intensity data [device-specific units].  If your
                         # device does not provide intensities, please leave
                         # the array empty.
