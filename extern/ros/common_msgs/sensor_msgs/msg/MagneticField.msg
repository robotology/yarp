 # Measurement of the Magnetic Field vector at a specific location.

 # If the covariance of the measurement is known, it should be filled in
 # (if all you know is the variance of each measurement, e.g. from the datasheet,
 #just put those along the diagonal)
 # A covariance matrix of all zeros will be interpreted as "covariance unknown",
 # and to use the data a covariance will have to be assumed or gotten from some
 # other source
