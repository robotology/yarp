# For the BOX type, the X, Y, and Z dimensions are the length of the corresponding

# For the CYLINDER and CONE types, the center line is oriented along
# the Z axis.  Therefore the CYLINDER_HEIGHT (CONE_HEIGHT) component
# of dimensions gives the height of the cylinder (cone).  The
# CYLINDER_RADIUS (CONE_RADIUS) component of dimensions gives the
# radius of the base of the cylinder (cone).  Cone and cylinder
# primitives are defined to be circular. The tip of the cone is
# pointing up, along +Z axis.
