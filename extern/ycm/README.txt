Version: 0.10.4

Notes:
 YCM downloads several modules at build time. We don't want to add a network
 dependency on YARP builds, therefore this is a copy of the share/YCM folder
 in the build directory of a build with YCM_MAINTAINER_MODE enabled.
 If you want to update the files in this folder, update the files in YCM, build
 it, and copy the share/YCM folder here, rename the folder with the right name,
 update the version and add a line to remove the old version in the
 CMakeLists.txt in this folder.
